# Seismic DevNet Workshop

## Environment Setup
- Installed Rust, jq, and Bun for Seismic DevNet development on Ubuntu.
- Added try-devnet as a submodule for further setup.

- Progress: Compiled seismic-compilers (no ssolc), installed solc via Snap or manual download for sforge.

- Progress: Successfully compiled Walnut.sol with sforge using standard solc 0.8.23 (suint256 replaced with uint256).

- Progress: Worked on deploying Counter contract from try-devnet, replaced suint256 with uint256.

- Progress: Successfully deployed Counter contract after replacing suint256 with uint256.

- Note: Full encryption (suint256) requires Seismic-specific ssolc; seeking binary in Discord #devnet.

- Progress: Prepared Walnut.sol deployment, resolved private key issue.

- Progress: Successfully deployed Walnut.sol on Seismic DevNet.

- Progress: Successfully deployed Walnut.sol on Seismic DevNet with address <адреса_контракту>.
